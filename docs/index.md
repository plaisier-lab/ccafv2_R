# ccAFv2
![Logo]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/logo.png)

**ccAFv2** is a high-resolution classifier for cell cycle state identification in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. It was trained on human neural stem cells and classifies six distinct cell cycle states (G1, Late G1, S, S/G2, G2/M, and M/Early G1) along with a Neural G0 state (G0). ccAFv2 incorporates a tunable parameter to refine classification certainty and outperforms existing methods while supporting additional cell cycle states.

Key Applications of ccAFv2:
- Identify cell cycle states in diverse cell types and germ layers.
- Classify cells, nuclei, and spatial transcriptomics data across species.
- Regress cell cycle expression patterns to reveal biological signals.
- Use as an [R package](https://github.com/plaisier-lab/ccafv2_R) (Seurat integration) or [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/ccAF/) (scanpy integration).
